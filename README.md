# DALL-E Clone

A full-stack project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that clones the functionality of DALL-E.

## Project Overview

The DALL-E Clone project allows users to generate images using the power of AI based on provided prompts. It utilizes the OpenAI API to generate images based on user input. The project consists of the following main features:

- **Home Screen:** Displays all the images that have been generated by the AI based on prompts.
- **Image Generation:** Allows users to generate images by providing their name and a prompt. The AI then generates an image based on the given prompt.
- **Community Sharing:** Provides an option for users to share the generated images with the community, making them visible to everyone.
